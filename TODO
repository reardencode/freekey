Reencryption

Ability to send an encrypted link to setup additional browsers (ie what's normally saved in a cookie / localStorage as a link).

Button to receive from clipboard and find a password by URL.

Maybe try to use postMessage to allow a bookmarklet ot retrieve user/pass combinations for other tabs.

Warn the user visually if there are unmerged duplicates.

More UI cleanups.

Error handling when HTTP timeout and stuff like that.

Some kind of test suite.

Make the clickable elements of the password list tab selectable.
