 - Undergoing rewrite from python installable application to completely
   downloadable and/or web loadable HTML/Javascript application.  You can check
   out the progress of this in the js subdir.  Eventually I'll rearrange to
   make that the primary.
 - The JavaScript version is intended to be a complete password manager that
   can be copied as a single HTML file to any device.  AWS credentials are
   stored in HTML5 localStorage, passwords are stored on S3 using the same
   scheme described in the debrecated README.old.md file.
